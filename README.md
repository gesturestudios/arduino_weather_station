# arduino_weather_station

Hi all,
This git repository is for documentation on the development of my Arduino weather station.  See the blog page on my website for more details about how the pieces go together:

The steps are:

1. Script to set up programs on an Ubuntu computer (install LAMP)
2. Set up mysql for recieveing data from the Arduino 
3. Deploy the Arduino with sensors to collect data and send to the LAMP server
4. Display via html page that shows image generated by R script via cronjob
